		<h1>Challenge Eight</h1>
		<p>Hello Mr. Soon to be Governor of Illinois!  We, your campaign team, have come up with the perfect plan for you!<p>
		<p>We plan to make use of the recent decline in potato output to put you at the top.  How can we use this decline, you may<p>
		<p>ask. Well, sir, we plan on having you steal an experimental super shovel from a foreign power.  This shovel is sure to<p> 
		<p>boost our agricultural output by at least 200%.  Unfortunatly, the foreign power in possesion of the shovel plans to launch</p>
		<p>it in to space for safe keeping within the next 48 hours.  We suggest, sir, that you break in to the office building launch</p>
		<p>facility and steal it as soon as possible.  Enjoy your <a href="SQ.jar">Shovel Quest</a>, sir!</p>
